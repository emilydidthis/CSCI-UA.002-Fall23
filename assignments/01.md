## Assignment #1
For this assignment you will be writing 3 programs which should be saved independently as their own ".py" file. The filename you should use for each program is outlined in the sections below. When you're finished you should submit your programs to the Assignment #1 category on Brightspace.

For each program, remember to comment your source code as if you were describing your code to someone who may be viewing it for the first time. Also include your name, the date, your class section and the name of your program at the top of your file.

You may work by yourself or with a partner. Remember, collaborating just entails discussing approaches to the problems; **you should not be writing actual code together**. If you choose to work with someone else please be sure to give them credit in your source code and on Brightspace when you submit your work.  Each member of a team must submit their own unique copy of the assignment to get credit for the assignment.

Make sure that IDLE is set up to use a fixed-width font (Courier is the font that I use in class) and that your font size is set to 14pt. On a Mac you can click on IDLE->Preferences to adjust your font size; On a PC you can click on Options->Configure IDLE

### Problem #1: Algorithmic Thinking (2 points)

Describe an algorithm in plain language to find the largest number in a list of random numbers. You do not need to write any code. Your steps should be written in plain English and your algorithm should work with any length list of numbers. 

Write each step as a code comment in a Python file and save it as LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem1.py (for example, "ZhaoEmily_assign1_problem1.py")

========================================================================

*0 points – Steps are not clear; instructions were not followed*  
*1 point – Parts of the algorithm might work, but there could still be more clarity*  
*2 points – Algorithm is specific, clear, and would successfully lead to the largest number being found in the list*

### Problem #2: Game Logic (3 points)
Describe the rules and logic of a game of Tic Tac Toe. Explain how the game is played and how a winner is determined. Pretend you're the game master walking two people through the game step by step. 

If you were to go about coding the game, what are some variables that you think you would need to define? Declare five valid variables and explain in comments what they would do. 

Please print out each step using the `print()` function. Declare your variables at the top. Save your file as LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem2.py (for example, "ZhaoEmily_assign1_problem2.py")

========================================================================

*[0-2 points] – Clarity of instruction*  
*[0-1 points] – Appropriateness of variables and their explanations*

### Problem #3: Math Expressions [Part A + B] (5 points total)

*Note: This program will require the use of the `format()` function, which is introduced in [Module 2](https://cs.nyu.edu/elearning/CSCI_UA_0002/module02.php#format).*

You have recently been hired by a local bakery to design a program that simplifies the conversion of recipe measurements. To help you get started, the bakery has provided you with a list of common conversions:

1 ml = 0.202884 tsp   
1 tbsp = 3 tsp  
1 cup = 16 tbsp  
1 pint = 2 cups  
1 quart = 2 pints  
1 gallon = 4 quarts  
1 floz = 29.5735 ml  

Using the formulas above, write a program that takes an initial user input in milliliters, and creates a table of all the conversions. Here's a sample run, using **250 milliliters** as an initial input: 

```
Enter an amount (in ML) to convert: 250.0
------------------------------------------------
          mL to US Fluid Volume Units                  
------------------------------------------------
ml:                     250.0
tsp:                    50.721000000000004
tbsp:                   16.907
cup(s):                 1.0566875
pint(s):                0.52834375
quart(s):               0.264171875
gallon(s):              0.06604296875
fl oz:                  8.453514125822105
```

While your output should match as closely as possible in terms of spacing, you do not worry about decimal point precision for this program (no numeric formatting required).


### But! Before you write any code...

In computer science, **pseudocode** is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm. You can think of it as writing---first in your native language---an outline or initial draft of an essay that you will eventually have to translate to French, or Python in our case.

**Part A (2 points)**  
Using code comments, write out your plan (aka the pseudocode), IN ENGLISH, for how you will approach creating this table. I'll get you started:

```
# First, I will determine the width of the entire table
# Then, I will figure out a way to center the title of the table by...
# ...
# For the two column layout, I will...
# ...
```

**Part B (3 points)**  
 Now you can code the program, following your plan above.
 
 Try your best to programatically figure out the spaces; I don't want to see strings defined like this:
 ```
 ml = "ml:            "
 ```
This is known as **\"hard-coding.\"** When programming, it's best to imagine that the content might change. If I suddenly wanted to increase or decrease the width of the table, I would have to go through each hardcoded variable, and manually add or subtract spaces---that sounds like a lot of work! Let's try to find a way to avoid that.
 

 This program should be named as follows: LastNameFirstName_assign1_problem3.py (for example, “ZhaoEmily_assign1_problem3.py”) Please include both parts A and B in the same file.

 ========================================================================

 *[0-2 points] Clarity of pseudocode in Part A; pseudocode is written in code comments*  
 *[0-1 points] Translation of pseudocode into actual code – I can clearly see how your logic became code*  
 *[0-2 points] Overall execution of program:*  
 *—utilizes input, print, and format functions correctly*  
 *—did not hardcode any variables*  
 *—output matches sample*
