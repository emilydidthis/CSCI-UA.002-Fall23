## IPO Notation

As you start writing more advanced functions you should think about documenting them based on their Input, Processing and Output (IPO)

Here is an example:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IPO/IPO-notation.png" width="60%">

<br>

If you include your IPO notation as multi-line comments directly inside of your function definition, when you call `help()` on your own function, the console will return whatever you have written inside that comment.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IPO/add-IPO.png" width="60%">
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IPO/help-function-IPO.png" width="60%">
